# Contrast-Stretching

Contrast stretching is one of the image enhancement techniques which increases the contrast of an image. Based on Wikipedia, contrast is determined by the difference in the colour and brightness of the object and other objects within the same field of view. In short, the difference in colour that is visible shows that there is s contrast between the colour. 

There are high contrast images and low contrast images. High-contrast images display a wide range of tones, from brighter color to darker color. Low-contrast images display less wider range of tones, in which the images mostly have the same hue.

Low-contrast images such as below.
